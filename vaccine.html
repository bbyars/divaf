        <p>An effective solution requires a clear definition of the problem and ensures the solution to one problem does not create another problem</p>
        <p>The solution must fit seamlessly into the existing environment without depending on a change in environmental factors</p>

        <p>Internal temperature distribution for maintenance of vaccines is critical to maintain the effectiveness of the active agent, the proteins or amino acid chains.  These chains are structured in a curled configuration during vaccine preparation at the lab.  <em>This structure is crucial to their effectiveness.</em></p>
        <p>The curled configuraion of the amino acid chains are maintained by a weak elecrical bond.  If the temperature is too warm, small amounts of heat energy break this bond and change the configuration to a different structure.  <em>This renders the vaccine ineffective.</em></p>
        <p>If the temperature is too cold, it alters the surface of the amino acid chain and dilutes the effectiveness of the vaccine as a function of the altered surface area.  In either case, too warm or too cold, <em>the chemical reaction is not reversible.</em></p>
        <p>The maintenance of the vaccine within a closely defined temperature range between vaccine preparation and vaccine administration is a critical factor in the effective use of this medical tool.  <em>The entire preparation and distribution effort can be wasted simply due to the failure to maintain proper temperature control over the vaccine during the intermediary process.</em></p>
        <p class="summary">Vaccines must be stored at a securely defined temperature range no cooler than 2&deg;C, and no warmer than 8&deg;C.
